A website im making so people can find events and such

It's Turkish only (maybe for now)

Here's an event I went to, displayed by my site:

<Group justify="center">
    <iframe
        src="https://events.deniz.blue/embed/events/675423692476197849d7f5f8"
        width="400"
        height="500"
        loading="lazy"
        style={{
            border: "0",
            borderRadius: "0.5rem",
        }}
    />
</Group>
