This project uses [react-reconciler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reconciler) to render React components into discord messages.

This allows you to use **all** React hooks in your components.

This was made as a proof of concept. I dont think anyone would ever actually want to use React to make a discord bot.

Below is an example that uses **effects** and **state** to render **embeds** and **message buttons**

```tsx
import { createJSXRenderer } from "@alan404/discordjsx";

const Test = () => {
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

	useEffect(() => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			setCounter(c => c + 10);
		}, 30_000);

		return () => clearInterval(interval);
	}, []);

    return (
        <msg>
            <embed
                color="Purple"
                title="discord-jsx Example"
            >
                Hello world!

                Counter: {counter}
            </embed>

            <row>
                <button onClick={() => setCounter(c => c-1)}>
                    -1
                </button>
                <button onClick={() => setCounter(c => c+1)}>
                    +1
                </button>
            </row>
        </msg>
    );
}

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
    if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

    await interaction.deferReply();

    createJSXRenderer(client, <Test />, async (msg) => {
        await interaction.editReply(msg);
    });
});
```
