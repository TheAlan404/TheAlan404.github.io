import { project, ProjectButton } from "~/types";
export const data = project({
	id: "minecraft-assets",

	shortDesc: "TypeScript library providing minecraft assets (block states, models and textures)",
	year: "2024",
	status: "up",

[minecraft-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-data) is NodeJS-only so I made this quickly,
it works on browsers plus its ✨ ESM ✨
