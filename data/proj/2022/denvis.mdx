I like Audio-Visual stuff so I added this equalizer-style thing to my desktop. Updates in real time of course.

It uses .NET/C# and some Windows API's to render a transparent window overlay and some interesting math stuff
(Fourier Transform) to render the bar.

It can also render snow!

For settings, I didn't want to bother with rendering UI in
C# so I expose a websocket in the app and made a [website](https://denvis.glitch.me/) for it :P

I do want to rewrite this in Rust sometime, making it platform-independent.
