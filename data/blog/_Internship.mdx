Hi! It's me, Deniz, im currently bored at metro so I decided I would actually start writing blog posts.

Now, a bit of context: the type of highschool that i went to does not provide internships. The friendly government that contains my school, however, does a mini internship available to students studying in my type of highschools.

I applied the first time I heard about it, they called me over and I had to basically fill some forms and do a small interview. A few weeks after that I was accepted! ðŸŽ‰ 

I remember the first day of the event. It was raining a lot, I got up at a time I *never* woke up in before. Now, from my house to the where I need to go is kinda far (10 kilometers or so) and they previously sent out a table of private bus services for us to get in contact with and possibly use. I did talk with the driver that goes near my house, and we agreed on a pickup spot.

At **6:50** am, I was at the pickup spot. The infographic they sent had "**7:00** am" written as their starting time. 20 minutes after I arrived, **7:10** am, the bus driver still wasn't there. I started panicking.

I called the bus driver, no response. At **7:20**am, I saw the bus! But uh, the bus *didnt* stop, or even *slow down* for that matter. I screamed after it I think, but the bus just kept going.

I was frustrated, I hopped on one of the public busses and started to go on my own. I was texting them telling what happened. At one point, the bus driver called me back! ...explaining how he was asleep and that apparently someone else took the route?? Awesome.
